* July 11, 2020: Implement the `predict` function in `wmseg_main.py`. You can use that function to segment the sentences in an input file with a pre-trained WMSeg model. See [run_sample.sh](./run_sample.sh) for the usage, and [./sample_data/sentences.txt](./sample_data/sentence.txt) for the input format.
* July 7, 2020: The release of [pre-trained WMSeg models](./models).
